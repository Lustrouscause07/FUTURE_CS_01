WEB APPLICATION SECURITY TESTING

I have conducted a comprehensive security test on a sample web application to detect vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws. Using tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and SQLMap, I also simulated real-world attacks in a controlled environment and documented my findings in a detailed report.
